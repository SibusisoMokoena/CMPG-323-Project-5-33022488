# NWU Tech Trends Reporting Dashboard

The goal of this project is for me to create a reporting system for NWU Tech Trends that illustrates how using Power BI can save time for each project and customer. To track these advantages and give stakeholders insight into the time saved on different projects and clients, the company needs a reporting dashboard. The information will facilitate decision-making, increase output, and point up opportunities for development.

**This project's main objective is to produce a Power BI report that shows important metrics related to client and project time savings. This report will allow stakeholders to:**

- Monitor the progress of different initiatives.
- Calculate and evaluate each project's efficiency improvements in terms of time saved.
- View client-specific information to determine which projects are the most and least efficient.
- Assist all parties involved in accessing current information about project performance and customer orders by creating a single source of truth.

# How Stakeholders Will Use the Report:
**Project managers, customers, and company leaders are just a few of the stakeholders that will Use the Power BI report. They will get it via the Power BI online service. Participants can:**

- Visualize Time Savings by using Graphs, charts, and tables make it simple to see how much time has been saved on various projects.
- They will be able to Monitor Client & Project Performance by comparing metrics related to client and project performance.
- Tracking Project Status by Keeping track of client orders to ensure accountability and transparency for every project.
- Filter Data for Particular Insights For in-depth study, apply filters to concentrate on particular time periods, clients, or projects.
- Also to Export Data , they may connect report parts with other decision-making tools or share insights by exporting them.
  
# Source Control and Usability

The data will be secured in the Power BI workspace, ensuring that only authorized users can view or manipulate the report.The report interface will be user-friendly, requiring minimal training for stakeholders to navigate and extract meaningful insights.
